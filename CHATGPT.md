# ChatGPT-Codex Collaboration

Purpose: let Amit, ChatGPT, Codex, and repository workers deliver useful milestones with minimal handoff overhead.

## Default Behavior

When the current objective is known, `go`, `g`, `.`, `Y`, `yes`, or equivalent affirmative continuation means: fetch current durable GitHub state and execute the approved objective within existing authority and constraints.

Do not start another planning round unless Amit explicitly asks for `plan`, `review`, `discuss`, or a decision. Stop only for a real safety, scope, authorization, repository-identity, access, or validation blocker.

Amit is the decision-maker, not the copy/paste transport layer. ChatGPT and Codex should fetch the owning Issue, PR, comments, current HEAD, and relevant validation themselves when accessible.

## Short Actor Names

For fast dictation and handoffs:

- `G` = ChatGPT.
- `X` = Codex.

Interpret these by sentence role, not capitalization alone. A standalone `g` remains the `go` continuation command; `G/g` used as an actor in a phrase means ChatGPT, for example `ask G to merge`. `X/x` used as an actor means Codex, for example `X must test`.

Actor aliases are shorthand only. They never widen scope, execution authority, merge permission, or safety gates.

## Roles

- Amit sets objectives, priorities, and hard stops.
- ChatGPT is the default controller/driver: understand intent, shape milestones, create/update Issues and PRs, review diffs, and directly complete small bounded GitHub-editable work when practical.
- Codex/repository workers handle deeper implementation, local/runtime investigation, validation, and longer engineering packages.
- GitHub Issue/PR/comments are the normal durable collaboration path.

A handoff coordinates work; it does not widen repository, cloud, production, merge, destructive, security, or publication authority.

## Repository Binding Guard

`CONTEXT.md` records the Primary Repository and optional Authorized Related Repositories.

Before a write, mutation, PR action, or implementation:

1. resolve the repository that owns the current objective;
2. compare it with the Primary Repository and any explicitly authorized related repositories;
3. confirm that the current Issue/PR belongs to that objective.

Reading or researching other repositories is allowed. Cross-repo writes are allowed when Amit explicitly requests them or the active SPEC/Issue clearly requires them.

If a short continuation such as `go` or `Y` points to an unrelated repository and intent is not explicit, stop with `BLOCKED_REPO_MISMATCH` and ask one short confirmation. Never bypass this guard merely because the referenced PR is the newest one.

## Optional Session Binding

Session metadata is useful coordination context, not authority. Populate it only when discoverable; never guess values or create Git churn only because a session identifier changed.

Codex may record:

- Directory: `~/git/<repo>`
- Thread name: `<repo or task>`
- Session: `<Codex session UUID>`

ChatGPT may record when available:

- Project: `<optional>`
- Chat name: `<optional>`
- Session ID or URL: `<optional>`

Repository identity, the active SPEC/Issue, and Amit's current instruction remain authoritative when session metadata is stale or absent.

## Handoff

Use the existing owning PR; if no PR exists, use the owning Issue. Do not create packet/outbox files for state already in GitHub.

Before acting, fetch the current PR HEAD and latest relevant handoff/comment. Reconcile stale state before implementation.

Keep return handoffs compact:

- `HANDOFF: CODEX` or `HANDOFF: CHATGPT`
- `Head: <sha>` when relevant
- `Result: PASS | PARTIAL | BLOCKED | FAIL | N/A`
- `Next: <one action>`
- `Accept: <one condition>` when needed

## Milestone And PR Economy

Optimize for the smallest useful release package, not the smallest possible PR.

Prefer one cohesive PR containing roughly 2-3 related phases or several tightly coupled tasks when they share one outcome, architecture, trust boundary, and acceptance path. A focused engineering package may represent several hours of work; this is scope guidance, never a clock requirement.

Do not split implementation, tests, docs, configuration, and directly related corrections into micro-PRs merely because individual edits are small. Real isolated defects, urgent safety fixes, and one-line corrections may still be small changes.

Finish the approved package, validate it proportionally, then return one reviewable result. Keep corrections in the same PR unless scope or trust boundary materially changes.

## Execution And Safety

`SPEC.md` is the repository execution contract. An ACTIVE SPEC/Issue may grant standing authority for explicitly bounded work, including personal lab cloud mutations, without repeated resource-by-resource approval.

Do not infer authority from repository visibility. A private repository may be personal or work; a public repository may still have strict mutation boundaries.

Explicit no-merge, no-production-mutation, destructive, credential, public-exposure, publication, or security gates remain binding. Technical failures are blockers even when mutation is authorized.

Never publish credentials, tokens, private keys, customer data, or raw sensitive infrastructure details.
